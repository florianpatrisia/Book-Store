This project was developed using the C++ programming language and relies on the principles of
object-oriented programming. We employed concepts such as classes, objects, encapsulation,
inheritance, and polymorphism to organize and manage the book collection efficiently and in a
structured manner. Through a console interface, users can interact with the system, having the
ability to add, delete, and modify books stored in a text file. Additionally, undo and redo functions
are available, allowing users to revert to the previous state of the book collection if needed
